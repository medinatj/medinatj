# 👋 Hi, I'm TJ Medina  

## 🚀 Senior Full Stack Software Engineer | Platform Engineering | Automation | AEM | AI

I build and enhance enterprise digital platforms by combining **Full Stack development, Platform Engineering, Automation, Continuous Improvement, and AI-driven solutions**.

Currently part of the **Digital Initiatives Team at Manulife (Segment Tech – MBPS)**, I focus on strengthening and evolving the **Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)** ecosystem while driving **AI enablement, cloud modernization, and enterprise automation initiatives**.

My engineering work centers around five core pillars:

- 🏗 **Platform Engineering**
- ⚙️ **Automation**
- 🔁 **Continuous Improvement**
- 🌐 **Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)**
- 🧠 **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

I design systems that are scalable, observable, reliable, and automation-first — reducing operational friction while enabling innovation.
